# progressive-enhancement
**This is my second project at BeCode !** It's called **"Progressive Enhancement"**. The whole exercise was about visually representing a story about a chinese farmer with a website.

# Programming languages used
`HTML, CSS, Javascript` the whole shebang.

# Any frameworks ?
Nope, just good ole fashioned code.
